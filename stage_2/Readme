# Public Health: Analyzing the NHANES Dataset

This repository contains a Python notebook (`Biochemistry_task_(2_4).ipynb`) that analyzes the relationship between the data of participants in the dataset

## Task Description

The task involved analyzing the dataset:

* **NHANES Dataset:** Contains data on health and nutritional status of adults and children in the US

The goal was to:

** Tasks**: 

** Process all NA (either by deleting or by converting to zero)

** Visualize the distribution of BMI, Weight, Weight in pounds (weight 2.2) and Age with an histogram.

** What's the mean 60-second pulse rate for all participants in the data?
** What's the range of values for diastolic blood pressure In all participants? 

** What's the variance and standard devlation for Income among all participants? 

** Visualize the relationship between weight and height? Color by:
   * Gender
   * Diabetes
   * smoking status 

** Conduct t-test between the following variables and make conclusions on the relationship between them based on P-Value 
   * Age and Gender
   * BMI and Dlabetes
   * Alcohol Year and Relationship Status


## Files
